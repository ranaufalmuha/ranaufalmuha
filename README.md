     👋🏻 Hi, I'm Ranaufal Muha
    </h1>

<h2>Creative Frontend & Web3 Engineer</h2>
<p>
      I enjoy building things where design, code, and decentralized systems meet.
Most of my work revolves around interactive frontend experiences, smart contracts,
and turning Web3 ideas into real, usable products.
<br/><br/>
Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time exploring blockchain architecture,
on-chain systems, and how decentralized infrastructure can actually make products better,
not just more complex.
